P0:
- sheet validations
  - correctly named sheets, maybe columns
  - probably better to run some unit tests against the sheet
- refactor out general AS lib

P1:
- unit tests
- read all emails, and ask admin to verify emails that should be parsed
- better trigger versioning
- Move client projects off of dev mode to versioned library

P2:
- option to add partial payment
- use dropdown list to select payment types in sheet config
- allow disabling outgoing emails in the config

P3:
- integrate with Plaid to *maybe* get Zelle Ids  
- automated way to unregister deleted clients

P4
- we get message date to use as transaction date. this date isn't always
  correct. in one example, email timestamp EST is day X at 2:43am, but
  message.getDate() is apparently day X-1

P0:
- config.ts to parse the config sheet
- get date from email to add payment, instead of assuming today
- add loan/interest features
- generalize terminology in code and config
- put spreadsheetId in new LibContext (research life cycle)
- integrate into live sheets
- restructure triggers
  - only the lib has triggers
  - scripts that depend on the lib register

P1:
- add option to add a full payment
- scheduled addition of rent due entry
- option to send thanks for your payment email
- parse email to input payments
- accommodate 0-interest loan
- Ensure email search ignores case
- Only make balace red in email for rent, not for loans

P2:
- instead of checking emails, let manual step be to label emails. script do the
  rest
- Add email display name to config for outgoing emails
- maybe manage triggers programatically?
  - https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/trigger-builder

P3:
- remove Zelle ID from balance row interface
